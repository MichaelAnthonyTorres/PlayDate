PlayDate will be an app where Parents are able to set up playdates with local parents. During this time of COVID-19 
it has become increasingly hard to have kids socialize with other kids. Parents are more reluctant to have their kids
outside but with this app there can be a common public place to meet, such as park or local playplace. Events can be 
set up by parents and limits can be set up with how many people can join the event. Each parent can create a profile 
that will The event planner example was what gave me the idea for this project. I also have kids of my own that I 
would like to be able to have socialize with more kids in a more controlled environemnt. 

One feature that I would like to include but im not sure how i would go about that is that meetings can only be set up 
in public places. Maybe you could report an event that includes a private address. 

Also would like to put past events on the user profile 

There will be a registration page
A profile page
    Profile will include Name
    Number of kids
    Age of kids 
    Dietary Restrictions( Important incase a child has a severe allergy, cannot bring certain items)
Make an event form
    Event form will include location date time and the allergy restrictions to make sure noone brings something harmful
An Event page
    Saw in the event planner to use the google maps api which i would do
    will include a check in button
    will also include a ratings button. This should create a rating for the person who created the event and not the event itself
    able to make comments on the event
